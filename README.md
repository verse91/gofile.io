## How to Use

### Install Dependencies

To get started with this project, you need to install the dependencies from the `req.txt` file. There are two ways to run the project: using standard Python or using **UV** (Astral's environment management tool).

#### 1. Using Python (Standard Method):

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r req.txt
   ```

2. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

#### 2. Using UV (Recommended):

**UV** is the recommended tool to run this project, as it can help you manage environments and run the application more easily.

1. Install **UV** and dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r req.txt
   ```

2. Run the app with **UV**:

   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```
